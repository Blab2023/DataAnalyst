## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Project 1

**Problem Statement:** 
A high school teacher needed help in grading multiple subjects’ exams and quiz,

**Modeling Approach:** 
Built a python script that manually load each students scores by subject for quiz, homework, attendance, and exam.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Project Outcomes:**
Automatically computes the Average Score, GPA (0 to 5.0), Grade and Status (Pass, Fail, Retake) and stores in a container for each student as per the provided rating scales.

### Project 2

**Problem Statement:**
Grocery Store Checkout App to record each sale and automatically compute total sale for a customer at check out and generate a receipt for the customer.

**Modeling Approach:** 
A python script was built to store information about the products by category in the store.

**Skills:** Use python variables, containers, User input functions, functions, conditional statements and Loops.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas.

**Project Outcomes:** The app store and automatically update inventory of each product after sale or restocking raise an alert if any product inventory falls below 5 pieces and allow the store owner to enter sales per item for each customer and generate a total sales receipt after the sale.

### Project 3

**Problem Statement:** 
A Football team is preparing for the next games season and have asked you to help clean and preprocess their data and hopefully help predict number of hits by each player

**Modeling Approach:** 
Conduct a full range cleaning of the data, preprocess the cleaned data and transform it into a well behaved data.

**Skills:** data cleaning, Explorative data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Project Outcomes:** A prediction model was built to predict the number of Hits of each payer
